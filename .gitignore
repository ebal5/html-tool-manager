# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   from different sources is not a concern, pipenv-resolver may be used to merge dependencies
#   from multiple Pipfile.lock files.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   For more info, see: https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
